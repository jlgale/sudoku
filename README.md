I was inspired by this article to write a sudoku solver.
I'm not sure if I'm smarter than Ron Jeffries, but my solver works for every puzzle I've tried. :)

Written in C, to make it more fun. No malloc.

Reads the board from a file and writes the solution to standard out.
Supports two board file formats, sdk and sdm.

Cheers, Jim
